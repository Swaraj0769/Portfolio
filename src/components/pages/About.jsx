        "Hi, I’m Swaraj Sanodiya, a passionate MERN stack developer with a strong interest in building user-friendly web applications and solving real-world problems through code. As a fresher, I’ve been working on projects like chatbots, location tracking, and image processing tools, which have helped me develop a solid foundation in React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I enjoy exploring new technologies, designing clean UIs, and writing efficient code. My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer while contributing to meaningful projects and collaborating with innovative teams. When I’m not coding, I love learning about new tech trends and enhancing my problem-solving skills."
